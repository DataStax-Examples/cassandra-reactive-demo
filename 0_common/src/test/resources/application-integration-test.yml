# An example of Spring configuration file specific to the "integration test" profile.
# It overrides the driver.consistency value defined in the main Spring configuration file with
# a value more suitable for integration tests.
# Important: driver settings defined in a Spring application file (YAML or XML) will NOT be
# automatically detected by the driver. You need to manually apply such settings to the driver
# configuration, possibly inside a Spring configuration class, and using the driver's
# ProgrammaticDriverConfigLoaderBuilder. See com.datastax.demo.common.conf.DriverConfiguration
# for an example of how to achieve this.
